dont use orig, use orig q
what happens if we are backing up something that is already a symlink
control file c and d are teh same


variables path to file = x
first edit
append line x to control file c	{
				if deeper than one line before, just edit, dont do backup thing, dont append line (hmmm,  will try making symlink from it to itself, so works fine....no it doesn,t as will make new bad backup)
				if less deep, works fine, remove other lines that are more deep
				in same folder, makes no difference, may as well stop, so dont append
				}
cp x /home/system/x with no overwrite
cp x /home/system/orig/x with no overwrite
rm x (need recursive delete method) (try without sudo first so you dont wipe entire disk)
ln -s /home/system/x x


new install

all:
change orig folder to orig.1 ####action needed
go through lines of control file !!!!!(install specific)!!!! one by one, as new variable y
cp y /home/system/orig/y overwrite
rm y (need recursive delete method) (try without sudo first so you dont wipe entire disk)
ln -s /home/system/y y

indiviually
new control file d for each install, to be handled automatically
see if "is it controlled called q*" exists, if not print, in !non! terminal "need control file"
if q* exists, read first line of q*, which is q which is the name of the install
now look at control file q
variable z* is file/folder we are clicking on
remove /home/system to make new variable z
look in control file
if different to anything in control file, append to control file
if the same file as one already done, dont do cp to orig, then prompt in non terminal for override, if yes rm and link, 
if new file is deeper, print in non terminal, already dealing with the custom file, this file has already been put into the system
if new file is less deep: copy files to orig without overwrite, remove z (remove symlinks wont remove actually files in more deep directories, where the new files are) and link as normal, control file: remove lines that are more deep, add this line in.


cp z /home/system/orig/y overwrite
rm y (need recursive delete method) (try without sudo first so you dont wipe entire disk)
ln -s /home/system/y y




restore individual k* when you realise hex editing is stupid:
scan through path deeper that where you are, and for each file replace associated edited file, with new "edited" file, which happens to be the original ,but is still in edit zone, ie
turn k* to k
then cp /home/system/orig/k /home/system/k with overwrites
even works if K* is /home/system/orig (ie everything) mean k is " " so cp /home/system/orig /home/system with overwrites
